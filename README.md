course demo app

This demo app is part of a 10 wk course introducing design students to server-side concepts.
In no way is this to be considered production ready source code.  Rather, it is a part 2
continuation of basic programming concepts interwoven with concepts of how a database driven site works.
In parallel, we develop both this site and an exisiting CMS such as ExpressionEngine, Wordpress, or Joomla.
My hopes are that they will better appreciate what goes on under the hood of a CMS.  In my experience, 
design students prefer EE because they don't feel constrained by its templating system.
